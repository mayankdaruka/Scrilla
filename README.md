This is an application created using React Native as part of the Texas Convergent Spring 2020 Finance Tech Build Team. The app relates to
budgeting. It oversees user finances, displays their transaction records, and maintains a system to handle the returning of bought items
before the return deadline of the specific item. Used the Back4App REST API for our Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).
